# Activity B: Design Documentation

## Design Documentation Requirements

### Visual / Interface Designs
- [ ] Create clear interface mockups or wireframes.

- [ ] Ensure each algorithm solves a key part of the proposed solution.
- [ ] Include both front-end and back-end logic where relevant.
- [ ] Ensure clarity so a third-party developer can implement them.

### Test Strategy

- [ ] Include tests related to security and compliance.

---

## Solution Scope and Complexity
- [ ] Confirm solution requires at least two programming languages.
- [ ] Ensure both front-end and back-end processes are represented.
- [ ] Ensure design documents provide enough detail for third-party implementation.
- [ ] Ensure documentation supports informed decision-making by the client.

## Appendices
